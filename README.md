# Udaan 18 Messenger Bot
Messenger Chat Bot for Udaan 18. This chat bot was develped so that students and other parties involved in Udaan could get quick information by just interacting with it. It leverages Facebook API and is mostly based on intelligent keywork matching. 

# Setup
1. Create a facebook developers account and then create your chat app.
2. Get the 'Access' and 'Verify' tokens. 
3. Save these tokens on your local machine as environment variables.
4. Train the chatterbot model by first running sample_chatter_bot.py
5. Then run server.py

The server should start on your local host machine. You may host this publicly by using ngrok. Or better, just use heroku.

Want to make this better? 
**Tip**: Try using a different model instead of the chatterbot one used here. You can use a model that uses NLP for the same.

That's it folks! You're all set up and good to go! Have fun interacting and tinkering the bot.
